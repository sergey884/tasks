* ## ATM function in JS
* ## Anagramm agroup  
The function gets array of string and find anagramma words and returns array, in which every element is array of anagramma strings.

* ## Carrying function in Javascript. Functional programming approach.

* ## Task for checking knowledge by JavaScript. 
It is necessary to implement function, which get array of urls, make request for each url and return results as an array. 
Requests must be async. It is allows to make limited amount of request, simultaniously. When we receive the result of some request, 
we must send another request. Urls in array may be repeated. We do not make request by repeated urls but in result array we must put 
all responses. For example. If we have array ['url1', 'url2', 'url3', 'url1', 'url3'] it is necessary 
to return ['resUrl1', 'resUrl2', 'resUrl3', 'resUrl1', 'resUrl3'] but we must make only three requests ('url1', 'url2', 'url3').

* ## Find subsequences
There are numbers array. It is necessary implement function which get that array, target and return subsequences which sum is equal to target. Return array of arrays if there are some subsequences which satisfy the condition.
